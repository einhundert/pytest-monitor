    Return the memory usage of a process or piece of code

    Parameters
    ----------
    proc : {int, string, tuple}, optional
        The process to monitor. Is a tuple
        representing a Python function. The tuple contains three
        values (f, args, kw) and specifies to run the function
        f(*args, **kw).
        Set to -1 (default) for current process.

    retval : bool, optional
        For profiling python functions. Save the return value of the profiled
        function. Return value of memory_usage becomes a tuple:
        (mem_usage, retval)

    Returns
    -------
    mem_usage : list of floating-point values
        memory usage, in MiB. It's length is always < timeout / interval
        if max_usage is given, returns the two elements maximum memory and
        number of measurements effectuated
    ret : return value of the profiled function
        Only returned if retval is set to True
